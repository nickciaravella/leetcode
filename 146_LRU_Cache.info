Optimal data structure

    {          head
                |
        a ---> Node
                |
        b ---> Node
                |
        c ---> Node
                |
               tail
    }

Doubly Linked List to maintain LRU order
Dictionary with key being cache item and value being pointer to the node

Dictionary - O(1) lookup for existance and locating in linked list
Linked List - O(1) insert, remove with LRU always at the head
